### Allegro Vita
Work in process implementation of Allegro 4.4.3 for PlayStation Vita.  

Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and generally abstracting away the underlying platform. However, Allegro is not a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like.

-If you are on Windows, install MSYS2 command shell  
-Clone allegro_vita repo into a folder somewhere  
-Compile and install:
